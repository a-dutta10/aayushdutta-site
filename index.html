    <h1>Aayush Dutta</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Aayush Dutta, a mechanical engineer from MIT, currently pursuing graduate studies in manufacturing and design. My work is driven by an interest in building physical systems that are robust, scalable, and thoughtfully engineered—from early concept through validation and production. I’m particularly motivated by problems where mechanical design intersects with automation, data, and real-world constraints.

      Across industry and academic projects, I’ve gravitated toward roles that involve turning complex requirements into practical, manufacturable solutions. I enjoy working close to hardware—designing, testing, and refining systems—while also using software and analytical tools to inform decisions and improve reliability. This combination has shaped how I approach engineering: with an emphasis on clarity, iteration, and engineering judgment.

      Looking ahead, I aim to work in industries such as advanced manufacturing, mobility, robotics, and energy, where mechanical systems play a central role in enabling scale and impact. I’m especially interested in fast-paced product-focused engineering roles that sit at the intersection of design, validation, and production, and in environments that value hands-on problem solving and long-term system thinking. You can find a more detailed overview of my experience and background in my resume.
